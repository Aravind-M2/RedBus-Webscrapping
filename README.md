# RedBus-Webscrapping
# Transportation Data Analysis  
This project automates data scraping, cleaning, and analysis for bus routes, costs, etc...  

## Features  
- Filter and sort transportation data.  
- Interactive interface using Streamlit.  

## Setup  
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the "Web-scrapping.py" to start scrapping the data from redbus site
3. Run the "Pre-processing_SQL_injection.py" to pre-process the data and inject it into the database 
4. Run the application locally with `streamlit run redbus_Streamlit_app.py` to open the streamlit application to perform analysis filtering and generate reports on scraped redbus data  
## Sample data 
1.copy the files in sample data and paste in the same path as .py files( or same path as .ipynb files - if you are going to use .ipynb files ) 
2.run the "Pre-processing_SQL_injection.py" to pre-process the data(previously collected) and inject it into the database
  (this data is for sample)
## Future Enhancements  
- Integration with remote databases and advanced visualizations.
